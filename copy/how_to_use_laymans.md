# How to use GhostCache (easy guide)

This is a short, plain-English guide for people who aren't technical.

What is this?
- GhostCache is a small app that lets you create an account, connect with other people, send messages, and upload or share files.

How do I open it?
- If someone set up the app for you, they will tell you a web address such as: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
- Open that address in your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

Create an account
1. Click "Register" or go to the Register page.
2. Pick a username (what people will see) and a password you can remember.
3. There is also a "destruction password" (a secondary password). If you enter the destruction password later instead of your regular password, your account will be removed.

Log in
1. Click "Login" and enter your username and password.
2. After logging in, you'll see the home page showing your account.

Add people and chat
- To add someone, go to "Connect" and enter their username.
- When they accept, you'll be able to chat with them. Use the chat page to send and receive messages.

Upload and share files
1. Go to "Upload" to send a file. After uploading you will receive a key — keep it safe if you need to download or share the file.
2. Files you upload are listed under "Files". You can download files you own or files others shared with you.
3. To share a file with another user, use the "Share" option on the file and enter their username.

Deleting things
- To delete a file you own, click the delete option next to that file.
- To delete your whole account, go to "Delete account" when logged in.

Problems and simple fixes
- If a page says something is missing, check you filled in every box (username, password, etc.).
- If a download fails, ask the person who ran the app to check the `uploads` folder on the computer running the server.
- If you see an error about sending JSON or a technical message, just tell the person who set up the app — they will adjust the settings.

Safety and privacy
- Passwords are stored in a secure format, but this app is for local/testing use. Do not use the same passwords you use on important services.
- If you lose the file key shown after upload, you may not be able to retrieve the file—keep keys safe.

Need help?
- If you get stuck, tell the person who installed the app for you and include the page you were on and the action you tried.
